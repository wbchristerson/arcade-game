### Running The Application

### Structure
* The game includes 15 levels in which the user must traverse a crossing which contains enemies.
* The user traverses the board using the arrow keys.
* When the user comes in contact with an enemy, he/she loses a life and returns to the start of the level at the default position on screen.
* The user can also collect gems (of varying point values) and stars (which give extra lives).
* If the user loses all lives, then the game ends in a loss. If the user completes all 15 levels with at least one life left, then the game ends in a win.
* When the game ends, the player may then play again or return to the introductory page.

### Design
The game begins with an introductory page explaining how to play. It also lists the possible avatars for the user, along with the keys to be pressed to switch to those avatars. The player begins by pressing the "space" key.
